# Welcome to Sapere's repository!

Sapere is a studying management web-based application that creates and acesses your study routine and easies the comunication between your tutors! Are you looking for an app to help you to get more organized about studying? It's done.

**Here, you can:**
- create
- blablabla
- yes, yes.

We'd use Flask (and Python, therefore) as the base of the project, beyond the web triad: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We used MySQL as the DBMS, and no ORMs, but a design pattern called DAO (Data Acess Object).
